\begin{abstract}
Tausch is a distributed protocol for constructing a set of bandwidth-efficient distributed broadcast channels.
The protocol operates in periodic rounds, in which each user optionally sends a datum to each channel they are broadcasting.
Each user also publishes an encrypted subscription vector, with elements ranging over broadcast channels.
The user receives the dot product of their subscription vector with the data vector for the round.
This allows group-testing style optimizations.
All computation is distributed.
